## Informal Project Presentations
In lab this week, you will be sharing (very informally) your project with your classmates. This is really just an opportunity to share what you're up to and get ideas and tips from your peers and TAs. Please come to lab prepared to answer the following questions:

1. What are you making and why are you making it?
1. What did you accomplish this week?
1. Was anything more difficult / time consuming than you expected?
1. Are you stuck on anything?
1. Did you have to adjust the scope of your project?
1. What are planning on doing next week?

Please also come prepared to listen to your peers and offer feedback and support. Many of you are exploring new ideas, technologies, APIs, etc. and are doing a lot of self-learning (which can be difficult and frustrating). This is also a time to share resources, websites, tools, approaches, etc. with one another. 

## What to Turn In
Nothing this week! You will be graded P/NP based on attendance and participation.
