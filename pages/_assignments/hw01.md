> ## Collaboration and Code Sharing Policy: Read Carefully
> For HW1, you are welcome to work in pairs (optional). You must still turn in your own HTML and CSS files and create your own GitHub repository, but you can collaborate on code and discuss code and strategies. If you collaborate, you'll just list your partner in the comments section of Canvas. 
> 
> We will be running MOSS on all assignments to ensure that everyone is doing their own work in good faith. For those who are collaborating, this is a way to be transparent about collaboration ahead of time (so if you happen get a code similarity flag via MOSS, we will ignore it). That said, please do not (a) "free ride" on your teammates or (b) enable free riders. Everyone in your group should understand every line of code they submit. 

In this assignment, you will create a high-fidelity prototype of a photo sharing app using HTML & CSS. You will complete all of the <a href="#requirements">requirements</a> and then submit your assignment via GitHub.

## Part 1: Setup

### 1. Create two files
Create a folder called `photo-app`. Inside of it, create two files -- an HTML file called `index.html` and a CSS file called `styles.css`.

### 2. Create a new GitHub repository
Log into GitHub and create a new __private__ GitHub repository. Name it `photo-app`. Please make it private so that others cannot see your code (for academic integrity considerations).

### 3. Connect your local files to your GitHub repository
Then, from within your `photo-app` on your command line, type the following: 

```bash
git init
git add .   # asks git to track all of the files in your folder
git commit -am "first commit"  # commit all of your files
git branch -M main  # create a new branch called main (moving away from "master" terminology in CS)   
git remote add origin ???
git push -u origin main
```

__NOTE:__ The above code sets up your initial repository. As a reminder, for any additional code changes:

1. Use `git status` to see all the files that your git repo is tracking, and which files have changed since you last committed. Note that the files listed in your .gitignore file are ignored by git.
1. Use `git add .` to ask git to track any new code files you create.
1. Use `git commit -am "my message"` to commit changes to your repository.
1. Use `git push origin main` to push changes to GitHub

## Part 2: Build the PhotoApp Interface
Using HTML & CSS (no JavaScript yet), you are going to build a webpage that looks like this: 

**Desktop Version**
<table class="interface-table">
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2">
            <img style="width:100%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/navbar.png"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="body">
        <td class="right">
            <img src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/stories.png"/>
            <img src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/card.png"/>
        </td>
        <td class="left">
            <img src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/recommendations.png"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

**Mobile Version**

Same as the desktop version, except that the recommendations panel is hidden (e.g. `display: none;`)
<table class="interface-table" style="width:50%;">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img style="width:100%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/navbar-mobile.png"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align:center;">
            <img style="width:95%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/stories.png"/>
            <img style="width:95%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/card.png"/>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

The webpage is composed of 4 components: a navigation bar, a recommendations, panel, a "stories" panel, and a series of cards that display a user's post and associated comments. Your web page should look nice on both mobile and desktop screens.

{:#requirements}
### Requirements

{:#navbar}
#### 1. Navigation Bar (2 points)

{:.checkbox-list}
* The title of the app (or logo) should be on the left-hand side
* The username and log out button should be on the right-hand side (grouped together)
* It should have a white background and some padding (so that it looks like the first figure shown below)
* Nav bar should be anchored to the top of the screen (fixed position)

The first image illustrates how the nav bar should look. The second illustrates one way of nesting HTML elements to produce the desired effect (each HTML element is outlined). Feel free to use your own approach. This is just a suggestion.

<img style="border: solid 1px #CCC;" class="large" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/navbar.png"/>
<img style="border: solid 1px #CCC;" class="large" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/navbar-debug.png"/>

{:#recommendations}
#### 2. Recommendations Panel (4 points)
The recommendations panel suggests accounts that the user should follow. It should look like the first figure shown below. Specifically:

{:.checkbox-list}
* A circular profile pic and a username of the current user should be at the top of the panel
* "Suggestions for you" text should be underneath the user profile
* 5 suggested accounts (use any names / pics you want) should be present
* Each suggested account should be displayed horizontally with a photo, username (with "suggested for you" below the username), and link to "follow" the user; the "follow" link should be blue but not have an underline

##### Tips 
* The second image below illustrates one way of nesting HTML elements to produce the desired effect (each HTML element is outlined). Feel free to use your own approach. This is just a suggestion.
* Consider using the placeholder image generator found here: <a href="https://picsum.photos/" target="_blank">https://picsum.photos/</a>. You're also welcome to use your own images. Up to you.

<img align="top" style="width:30%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/recommendations.png"/>
<img style="width:35%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/recommendations-debug.png"/>


{:#stories}
#### 3. Stories Panel (3 points)
The stories panel displays stories of accounts that the user follows. It should look like the first figure shown below. Specifically:

{:.checkbox-list}
* Each story should be represented by a circular profile pic on top and a username underneath
* There should be 5 stories displayed
* All of the stories should be left-justified

The second image (below) illustrates one way of nesting HTML elements to produce the desired effect. Feel free to use your own approach. This is just a suggestion.
<img style="width:80%;border: solid 1px #CCC;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/stories.png"/>
<img style="width:80%;border: solid 1px #CCC;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/stories-debug.png"/>

{:#card}
#### 4. Card (7 points)
The card represents a post in your photo sharing app. It is the most complicated widget in your webpage, consisting of the username of the person who posted the image, the image itself, a caption, buttons, a list of comments, and the ability to post a comment. It should look like the first figure shown below. Specifically:

{:.checkbox-list}
* The top of the card should have the creator's username and an icon with 3 dots
* The picture should be displayed below the username
* There should be a row of icons (heart, comment, and plane on the left; bookmark on the right) below the picture
* There should be bolded text with the number of likes below the icons
* The caption of the photo, with the creator's username, the text of the caption, and a "more" link (respectively) should be below the likes
* Below the caption, display 2 comments with the commentor's username and the text of the comment (as pictured)
* Finally, create an "Add a comment section" with a smiley face, a text input, and a "Post" link (as pictured)

##### Tips
Consider using Font Awesome to display the icons. To do this, embed the following link within the head section of your HTML file...

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Photo App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.11.2/css/all.min.css">
    ...
</head>
<body>
    <i class="far fa-smile"></i>
</body>
</html>
```

...and then use the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons?m=free" target="_blank">documentation</a> to find the icons you want!

<img align="top" style="width:60%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/card.png"/>

<img style="width:60%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/card-debug.png"/>


{:#composition}
#### 5. Composition (5 points)

{:.checkbox-list}
* Headings should use the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?category=Serif,Display,Handwriting" target="_blank">Comfortaa</a> font family. Body copy should use any sans-serif font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, etc.)
* Arrange the 4 components as shown below
    * Nav bar at the top (fixed)
    * Recommendations on the right (fixed)
    * Stories and posts on the left, scrollable
* There should be 4 posts showing (feel free top copy the same post multiple times, as this is just a prototype)
* Desktop view: The Navigation Bar and Recommendations Panel should stay in place as the user scrolls (see animation below) 
* Mobile view: The Navigation Bar should stay in place as the user scrolls; the Recommendations Panel should be hidden (see animation below)

##### Desktop Interface
<img style="width:95%;border:solid 1px #CCC;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/hw01-desktop.gif"/>

##### Mobile Interface
Same as the desktop version, except that the side panel is missing, and there is less spacing around the cards:

<img  class="frame medium" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw01/hw01-mobile.gif"/>

{:#accessibility}
#### 6. Accessibility (3 points)

{:.checkbox-list}
* Make sure your site is tabbable: that is, **all links** can be accessed **without** the use of the mouse, by simply using the tab key to get to them 
    * Hint: this should be automatic unless you change the CSS or are not using the appropriate tag
* Make sure **font colors** have sufficient **contrast** with the background being used 
    * Hint: there are a couple tools that help analyze contrast on the [course's accessibility resources](/winter2022/accessibility-reference)
* In a **comment at the end of your HTML file, describe** how you would add a feature so users can **easily add alt-text** to their images 
    * Hint: <a href="https://accessnow.com/blog/how-to-add-alt-text-to-instagram-photos/" target="_blank">a way to do so exists</a> but is difficult to find

{:#github}
#### 7. GitHub (1 point)
When you're done, please commit all of your changes and push them to your `photo-app` GitHub repo.
