For your last homework assignment, you have two options:

{:.compact}
1. Implementing a React version of your Photo App
2. Implementing a chat interface to interact with users with whom you have a mutual following relationship (you follow them AND they follow you).

## Option 1: React Re-Implementation

### Overview
At a high level, we want you to re-implement your HW4 code in way that follows React conventions. A few ground rules:
1. You can use functional or class components (<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/react-choose-functional-components" target="_blank">What's the difference?</a>). Sarah used class components in her demos, but go with what you prefer. We have no preference.
2. You can use third-party libraries if you want (but it's not required).
3. We won't be grading you on CSS, but please do make it look nice. You're also welcome to customize the look and feel to make it your own.
4. We've implemented a react version of the PhotoApp here: <a href="https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/</a>. Yours should function similarly.

> ### Tips
> * If you're running into any errors with fetch requests, you may have a few minor bugs in your REST API Endpoint. To verify (*Is the bug in my React code or in my API?*), try running your code using the course API by updating your React app's `proxy` url address in `package.json` to: <a href="https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/</a>.
> * If you're switching between the course API and your API to debug, note that you'll either have to clear out your `access_token_cookie` manually (by physically deleting it using the Application panel of your browswer's developer tools) or else use the same JWT_SECRET as the course application (set in your `.env` file), which is **MY_SECRET** (e.g., `JWT_SECRET=MY_SECRET`).
> * By default, your JWT token will time out every 15 minutes. To make your life easier, consider extending the life of your JWT token by adding the code below to your `app.py` file: 

```python
# Import timedelta at the top:
from datetime import timedelta

# Put this setting with all of your other JWT settings:
app.config["JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES"] = timedelta(days=30)
```

### Tasks
In the section below, we've mapped out a suggested implementation strategy. If you implement your React functionality differently, that's fine, but we will be verifying that you did indeed make a series of components (versus just copying your HW4 file into a React folder and only making minor changes).

You could create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Comments</code> and/or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Comment</code> child component, or you could render comments directly in your Post's render method.

                Fetch and Redraw Post
            </td>
            <td>
                Within your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> component, you will also have to write some code to redraw a post after its structure is modified (liked/unliked, bookmarked/unbookmarked, etc.). We recommend that you create a function called <code class="highlighter-rouge">requeryPost</code> that:
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>
                        Re-queries the post from <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/posts/&lt;id&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>
                        Updates the state of your component to reflect that the post data has changed (which will in turn re-render the component).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                You will also want to give some of your child components access to this function (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">LikeButton</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">BookmarkButton</code>, etc.) by passing a reference to this function as a property. This way, the child components can also trigger a post redraw by invoking its parent's <code class="highlighter-rouge">requeryPost</code> function.

### Deployment Instructions (Optional)
In order to deploy your React code, you have two options.

#### 1. Create a Stand-Alone React App
1. Create a git repository that has your react app as a top-level directory (see suggested file structure below).
1. Create a `.gitignore` file that excludes the `node_modules` and `build` directories (see below).
1. Update all of your API urls (the ones that issue fetch requests) to point to your production REST API (or the class API if your HW5 deployment is broken). 
1. Modify your `package.json` file (which should be at the root of your git repo) and delete the "proxy" entry (`"proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:5000",`). Note that you can't comment out entries in a JSON file, so you'll have to actually delete it.
1. Commit and push your new repo.
1. Create a new Heroku instance and connect it to your new GitHub repo.
    * Deploy (just like you did in previous homeworks).
    * Note that you don't need to configure any environment variables -- Herou will automatically read your `package.json` file, install the dependencies, and create a production build for you.
1. That should be it!

**Suggested File Structure:**
```shell
your-react-app
├── .git
├── .gitignore
├── build               # build should be excluded from the repo
├── node_modules        # node_modules should be excluded from the repo
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── public
└── src
```

**.gitignore file**
```shell
node_modules
build
```

#### 2. Integrate with Flask
1. Paste your react client folder (I called mine `react-client`) at the root of your Flask app (see suggested dile structure below). Just for simplicity, rename that folder to `react-client`.
1. Create a `package.json` file at the root of your Flask app (note that this is in addition to the `package.json` file inside of your `react-client` directory) that has the JSON format shown below.
    * This file tells Heroku to compile your react app from within the `react-client` subdirectory.
1. Update your `requirements.txt` to include the following: `flask-multistatic==1.0`
    * You will also need to install this library on your local machine: `pip3 install flask-multistatic`.
1. Modify your `app.py` as shown below.
1. Ensure that your `react-client/node_modules` and `react-client/build` folders are excluded from git via your `.gitignore file`.
1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
1. Create a new Heroku instance and connect it to your new GitHub repo.
    * Install the Node buildpack (Settings Tab > "Add Buildpack" button > nodejs)
    * Deploy (just like you did in previous homeworks).
    * Herou will automatically read your `package.json` file, install the dependencies, and create a production React build for you.
1. That should be it!

**Suggested File Structure:**
```shell
photo-app
├── .env
├── .git
├── .gitignore
├── Procfile
├── README.md
├── app.py
├── decorators.py
├── models
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── populate.py
├── react-client
├── requirements.txt
├── sql
├── static
├── templates
├── tests
└── views
```

**package.json file at the root of your Flask app** (not the one in your `react-client` folder):
```json
{
    "name": "photo-app-heroku-react-build-file",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "scripts": {
      "build": "cd react-client && npm install && npm run build"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "cross-env": "^7.0.3"
    }
}  
```

**app.py updates:**
```python
from flask_multistatic import MultiStaticFlask as Flask   # at the top
from flask import send_from_directory                     # at the top


# place the following after: app = Flask(__name__)
app.static_folder = [
    os.path.join(app.root_path, 'react-client', 'build', 'static'),
    os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static')
]

# modify the root path to point to your React App:
@app.route('/')
@decorators.jwt_or_login
def home():
    # https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-deploy-a-react-python-flask-project-on-heroku-edb99309311
    return send_from_directory(app.root_path + '/react-client/build', 'index.html')

```

## Option 2: Chat Interface
<!-- Specs coming soon. -->

### Introduction
In order to build a chat interface, you will:

1. Extend the flask code (both the client and the server functionality) from HW5. Recall: the Flask server's job is to serve data (via the REST API) and the HTML/CSS/JavaScript files that control the user interface.
1. Extend the web socket server you created for Lab 8. The web socket server's job is to ensure that authenticated users can relay messages to their contacts.

Both servers will need to be run simultaneously (Flask on port 5000, Web Sockets Server on port 8081) in order to complete the assignment.

### Set Up
1. In your `photo-app` codebase, please create a new branch for your HW6 updates. See previous homeworks for instructions for creating a new branch.
2. Download the Lab 8 solutions from Canvas and save them somewhere that makes sense. You will be modifying and running the `server/app.py` file, which will be the basis for your chat server.

Please complete the following tasks:

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Location</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>5pts</td>
            <td>Flask Server</td>
            <td>
                <strong>REST API Endpoint</strong><br>
                <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/contacts</code>
            </td>
            <td>
                Create a new REST API Endpoint, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/contacts</code>, that returns a list of the user's contacts. A contact is a reciprocal relationship. Given two users A and B: A follows B and B follows A.
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>The endpoint will return a list of User objects (just like the suggestions endpoint).</li>
                </ul>

                JWT Validation
            </td>
            <td>
                Instead of letting <strong>anyone</strong> use your chat server, you will now only allow authenticated users to use the chat server. Users will authenticate by including a valid JWT token (issued by your Flask app) in their chat messages. To enable this:
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Modify the rules of the chat server so that all JSON messages require an <code class="highlighter-rouge">access_token</code>.</li>
                    <li>Use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">jwt</code> library (<code class="highlighter-rouge">pip3 install PyJWT</code>) to decrypt and validate the token. This includes checking that it can be decoded and that it hasn't expired.</li>
                    <li>To decode the token, you'll have to use the same secret as is used in your flask app.</li>
                </ul>

            </td>
            <td>
                If the message "type" is "login":
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Store the decoded user_id (from the JWT) and the websocket in memory (so we can track which users are logged into the system).</li>
                    <li>
                        Issue a request to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/contacts</code> (make sure you include the access_token in the header), and then store the user's contacts in the chat server's memory.
                    </li>
                    <li>Broadcast a message to any user in the system who is "logged in" and a contact of the person who just logged in. This will allow the UI to display to other users of the system which of their contacts are logged in.</li>

                Chat interfaces dynamically inject new elements into the DOM as messages are broadcasted from the web sockets server. To make a screen reader aware of these changes, please complete the following tasks:
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>
                        Ensure that the container that holds your chat messages and contact list has the <code class="highlighter-rouge">aria-live</code> attribute (set to polite or assertive). This will indicate to your screen reader that the elements therein will be dynamic.
                    </li>
                    <li>Please ensure that the user is notified by the screen reader when:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A new message is received</li>
                            <li>A new contact logs into chat</li>
                            <li>A new contact logs out of chat</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

### Extra Credit
You may earn up to 5 points extra credit. If you are working in partners, your extra credit will be split between the two of you (i.e. you will have to implement 10 points worth of extra credit to earn 5 points each).
<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Component / Task</th>

## Accessibility Reflection
If you already completed this in Lab 9, you can skip it. But in case you missed it...

### Accessibility Questionnaire 
This quarter, we assigned a few accessibility activities -- to encourage you to think about how people might interact with your applications without mouse or using a screen reader. To reflect on this process, please fill out the <a href="https://t.ly/SK2i" target="_blank">Accessibility Questionnaire</a>.

### Accessibility Research Study
We also wanted to invite you to participate in a research study -- to examine and reflect on how to better teach students about accessibility within the software development process. Please fill out this <a href="https://t.ly/x5M7" target="_blank">Consent to participate in research form</a> to let us know whether or not you are willing participate in this study. Participation is **totally optional.** 

> ### Appreciations
> And while you're at it, please take a moment to thank  / write a note to a peer mentor who helped you in some way (even if you just take 30 seconds to do it). Peer mentors are students too, and most of them do waaaay more than what is officially asked of them in order to support you. This form is completely anonymous.
