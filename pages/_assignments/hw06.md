For your last homework assignment, you have two options:

{:.compact}
1. Implementing a React version of your Photo App
2. Implementing a chat interface to interact with users with whom you have a mutual following relationship (you follow them AND they follow you).

## Option 1: React Re-Implementation

### Overview
At a high level, we want you to re-implement your HW4 code in way that follows React conventions. A few ground rules:
1. You can use functional or class components (<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/react-choose-functional-components" target="_blank">What's the difference?</a>). Sarah used class components in her demos, but go with what you prefer. We have no preference.
2. You can use third-party libraries if you want (but it's not required).
3. We won't be grading you on CSS, but please do make it look nice. You're also welcome to customize the look and feel to make it your own.
4. We've implemented a react version of the PhotoApp here: <a href="https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/</a>. Yours should function similarly.

> ### Tips
> * If you're running into any errors with fetch requests, you may have a few minor bugs in your REST API Endpoint. To verify (*Is the bug in my React code or in my API?*), try running your code using the course API by updating your React app's `proxy` url address in `package.json` to: <a href="https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://photo-app-secured.herokuapp.com/</a>.
> * If you're switching between the course API and your API to debug, note that you'll either have to clear out your `access_token_cookie` manually (by physically deleting it using the Application panel of your browswer's developer tools) or else use the same JWT_SECRET as the course application (set in your `.env` file), which is **MY_SECRET** (e.g., `JWT_SECRET=MY_SECRET`).
> * By default, your JWT token will time out every 15 minutes. To make your life easier, consider extending the life of your JWT token by adding the code below to your `app.py` file: 

```python
# Import timedelta at the top:
from datetime import timedelta

# Put this setting with all of your other JWT settings:
app.config["JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES"] = timedelta(days=30)
```

### Tasks
In the section below, we've mapped out a suggested implementation strategy. If you implement your React functionality differently, that's fine, but we will be verifying that you did indeed make a series of components (versus just copying your HW4 file into a React folder and only making minor changes).

You could create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Comments</code> and/or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Comment</code> child component, or you could render comments directly in your Post's render method.

                Fetch and Redraw Post
            </td>
            <td>
                Within your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> component, you will also have to write some code to redraw a post after its structure is modified (liked/unliked, bookmarked/unbookmarked, etc.). We recommend that you create a function called <code class="highlighter-rouge">requeryPost</code> that:
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>
                        Re-queries the post from <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/posts/&lt;id&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>
                        Updates the state of your component to reflect that the post data has changed (which will in turn re-render the component).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                You will also want to give some of your child components access to this function (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">LikeButton</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">BookmarkButton</code>, etc.) by passing a reference to this function as a property. This way, the child components can also trigger a post redraw by invoking its parent's <code class="highlighter-rouge">requeryPost</code> function.

### Extra Credit
You may earn up to 5 points extra credit. If you are working in partners, your extra credit will be split between the two of you (i.e. you will have to implement 10 points worth of extra credit to earn 5 points each).

            <td>
                Implement the "show modal" functionality using a react component. This will involve making a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Modal</code> component (and not just copying your old modal code into your react app).

## Option 2: Chat Interface
Specs coming soon.

<!-- In order to build a chat interface, you will:

{:.compact}
1. Extend the server-side and client-side code in your Flask Application (from HW5), and 
2. Create a stand-alone web sockets server to power your photo app's chat capability. 

Please complete the following tasks:

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>5pts</td>
            <td>
                <strong>Your Contacts</strong><br>
                REST API Endpoint
            </td>
            <td>
                Create a new REST API Endpoint, <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/contacts</code>, that returns a list of the user's contacts. A contact is a reciprocal relationship. Given two users A and B: A follows B and B follows A. <br>The endpoint will return a list of User objects (just like the suggestions endpoint).
