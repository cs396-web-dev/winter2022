For your last homework assignment, you have two options:

{:.compact}
1. Implementing a React version of your Photo App
2. Implementing a chat interface to interact with users with whom you have a mutual following relationship (you follow them AND they follow you).

The specs of this assignment will be fleshed out by Thursday morning.

                    <li>
                        (Same as HW2) If there is more than one comment associated with the post, display a “view all n comments” button and the first post below it (replace n by the actual number of comments). Otherwise, display a single comment below the title of the post (if one exists).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the current user has already liked the post, the heart icon should be red <i style="color: #cf0c0c" class="fas fa-heart"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-heart"></i>. Consider using the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">current_user_like_id</code> attribute included in the post object.

                    <li>
                        If the current user has already bookmarked the post, the bookmark icon should be black <i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>. Consider using the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">current_user_bookmark_id</code> attribute included in the post object.
