## Introduction
In this assignment, you are going to build part of a graphical user interface (i.e. web client) to interact your Doctor Who REST API, using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Here are some links to relevant lectures that cover the technologies you will be using:

* [L07: Intro to Client-Side Web Programming](../lectures/lecture07)
* [L08: Templates & Event Handlers](../lectures/lecture08)
* [L09: Fetch API](../lectures/lecture09)

### A Few Guidelines

* You may work with a partner (same collaboration policy as in [HW 1 & 2](hw01/)).
* You may **NOT** use any JavaScript frameworks. Everything must be completed using "Vanilla" JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 


## Part 1: Set Up Your Files
<a class="nu-button" href="/winter2022/course-files/assignments/doctor-who-ui.zip?updated=1">doctor-who-ui.zip<i class="fas fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

Download `doctor-who-ui.zip`, which is a modified version of the Homework 2 files. 

### Changelog
The files you're downloading are the same as the ones in HW2, with the following exceptions:
1. There is a new version of the `config/data.json` file. The file has the same doctors and companions, but new data fields have been added:
   * `image_url` -- to store an image of each doctor / companion.
   * `ordering` -- to help sort doctors / companions chronologically.
2. The `src/schemas/Doctor.js` and `src/schemas/Companion.js` schemas have been updated to accommodate the (optional) new fields.
3. The `index.js` is now listening for static media requests in the `public` directory, which is controlled by the following line of code: 
   * `app.use(express.static('public'))`
4. There is a new testing file: `test/new-tests.js`.

### Configure your new server
Please complete the following steps to configure your new server:
1. Copy the `.env` file you have been using all quarter into the root of your `doctor-who-ui` directory.
2. Copy your completed `routes.js` from Homework 2 into the `src` directory (replacing the current one).
3. Install the dependencies `npm install`
4. Populate your DB: `npm run populate`
5. Run your server: `npm start`
6. Run your tests again (in a different terminal window): `npm test`
    * All of the tests should pass (if they passed before) except for some of the ones in `test/new-tests.js`. You will fix this failing tests in Part 2 (below).

{:#tasks}
## Part 2: Back-End (Server) Updates
Please modify your routes.js file as follows:

### 1. Update POST & PATCH routes to honor the new attributes (1 point)

Since the `Doctor.js` and `Companion.js` schemas have changed, you may need to update the endpoints listed below so that the `image_url` and `ordering` attributes are saved to the database:

* /doctors (POST)
* /doctors/:id (PATCH)
* /companions (POST)
* /companions/:id (PATCH)

**NOTE:** If the new `POST` and `PATCH` tests already pass (in `test/new-tests.js`), it means that you can skip this step (because you've already implemented your endpoints in a way that allows for new attributes).

### 2. Add sorting to the /doctors and /companions GET endpoint (1 point)
You will also modify the `/doctors` and `/companions` GET endpoint (in `routes.js`) so that each respective list is sorted by the `ordering` attribute. To do this, include the [.sort()](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/query.html#query_Query-sort) function to the end of you `find()` query. For instance:

```js
Doctor
    .find({})
    .sort('ordering')  // sort by the "ordering" attribute
    .then(...)
```

### 3. Verify your changes
When you're done, run the tests again and they should all pass!


## Part 3: Front-End (Client) Updates
In Part 3, you will be making the **editor** for your web client. To do this, you will be making all of your edits in the `public` directory, which contains the following files:

{:.light-editor}
```bash
├── css
│   └── editor.css
├── scripts
│    └── editor.js
└── editor.html
```

For the Editor UI, you will be making changes to `editor.html` and `scripts/editor.js`. You're welcome to edit the CSS file, but we won't be evaluating you on the styling of your editor.

Navigate to: <a href="http://localhost:8081/editor.html" target="_blank">http://localhost:8081/editor.html</a> to preview the current state of this page -- don't forget to start your server (`npm start`).

Then, open `editor.html` and `scripts/editor.js` in your code editor. 
* Note that `editor.html` has a few empty sections but not much else. You'll be dynamically creating the panels (by responding to user events) using JavaScript.
* Note that in `scripts/editor.js`, there is already one function implemented for you -- `initResetButton` which attaches a `click` event handler to the button with the id of "reset". When clicked, the event handler issues a request to the <a href="http://localhost:8081/reset" target="_blank">/reset</a> API Endpoint (which resets the database). While this is useful for testing in this class, it's a terrible idea in real life.

After getting oriented with the two files, please complete the following tasks using JavaScript (you are also welcome to modify the HTML or CSS if it helps you achieve the required functionality):

### 1. Display all of the doctors (2 Points)
When the page loads, fetch all of the doctors from your <a href="http://localhost:8081/doctors" target="_blank">http://localhost:8081/doctors</a> endpoint, and display the names of all of the doctors in the left-hand panel. We suggest that you render the doctors as a list of anchor tags. There is an example of how to do something like this in <a href="https://github.com/cs396-web-dev/winter2022/tree/main/course-files/lectures/lecture09/public/answers/01_get_advanced" target="_blank">Lecture 9</a>, but feel free to do it your way. 

### 2. Display individual doctor and associated companions (4 Points)
When the user clicks on one of the doctors, display the following:
* A panel showing the doctor's name, picture, and seasons (2 points).
* A panel showing all of the companions that traveled with that particular doctor (2 points).

#### Hints:
* This may require 2 fetch requests to be issued simultaneously ((depending on how you chose to implement this functionality): one to `/doctors/:id` and one to `/doctors/:id/companions`. 
* It is common, in front-end programming, to issue many asynchronous function calls, as these calls don't necessarily have to wait for one another.

### 3. Add the ability to create a new doctor (6 Points)
* [1 pt] Add a "create doctor" button to your UI. When the user clicks this button, the UI should show a form on the screen that allows the user to input the data to create a new doctor.
* If the user clicks the save button. Check the data the user entered and make sure it is valid.
   * [2 pts] If it is:
        * [1 pt] Issue a `POST` request to the `/doctors/` endpoint with the data the user inputted.
        * [0.5 pts] Redraw the left-hand panel so that the new doctor is now in the list.
        * [0.5 pts] Show the new doctor in the doctor "detail" panel (as shown in the video).
   * [2 pts] If it isn't, display a message to the user asking them to fix the data.
* [1 pts] If the user clicks the cancel button, hide the "detail" panels (only the doctor list should be showing).

Here is sample code for an HTML form that you're welcome to use:

```html
<form>
    <!-- Name -->
    <label for="name">Name</label>
    <input type="text" id="name">

    <!-- Seasons -->
    <label for="seasons">Seasons</label>
    <input type="text" id="seasons">

    <!-- Ordering -->
    <label for="ordering">Ordering</label>
    <input type="text" id="ordering">

    <!-- Image -->
    <label for="image_url">Image</label>
    <input type="text" id="image_url">

    <!-- Buttons -->
    <button class="btn btn-main" id="create">Save</button>
    <button class="btn" id="cancel">Cancel</button>
</form>
```

See demo video below:

<iframe src="https://northwestern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=6b8eb974-10ef-404a-a292-ad1b00ed475f&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&start=0&interactivity=all" height="405" style="border: 1px solid #464646;width:100%;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

### 4. Add the ability to edit an existing doctor (6 points)
* [1 pt] Inside of the panel showing the doctor's name, picture, and seasons, add an "Edit" button. When the user clicks this button, the UI should show a form on the screen that is pre-populated with the doctor's existing data (which the user will be able to edit).
* If the user clicks the save button. Check the data the user entered and make sure it is valid.
   * [2 pts] If it is:
        * [1 pt] Issue a `PATCH` request to the `/doctors/:id` endpoint with the data the user inputted.
        * [0.5 pt] Redraw the left-hand panel so that any updates to the doctor are reflected in the list.
        * [0.5 pt] Show the "detail panel" with the edited doctor's updated information.
   * [2 pts] If it isn't, display a message to the user asking them to fix the data.
* [1 pt] If the user clicks the cancel button, show the "detail panel" with the doctor's information. See demo video below:

<iframe src="https://northwestern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=70b60bff-29d1-4662-ba52-ad1b00ed47c8&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&start=0&interactivity=all" height="405" style="border: 1px solid #464646;width:100%;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

### 5. UI to Delete a Doctor (2 Points)
* Inside of the panel showing the doctor's name, picture, and seasons, add a "Delete" button. When the user clicks this button, prompt the user with a confirmation message, asking them whether they're sure they want to delete the doctors (consider using the built-in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm" target="_blank">confirm</a> function).
  * [1.5 pts] If they say "OK":
       * [1 pt] Issue a `DELETE` request to the `/doctors/:id` endpoint.
       * [0.5 pt] Redraws the left-hand panel so that any updates to the doctor are reflected in the list; hides the "detail" panels (only the doctor list should be showing).
  * [0.5 pts] If the user cancels, show the "detail panel" with the doctor's information. 
  
See demo video below:

### 6. Extra Credit (Up to 6 Points)
* [2 pt] Allow the user to edit a companion (see video below)
* [1 pt] Allow the user to delete a companion (see video below)
* [2 pt] Allow the user to add a new a companion for the specific doctor (see video below)
* [2 pt] Allow the user to favorite a doctor or companion
* [2 pt] Allow the user to view their favorite doctors / companions

Here is a <a href="https://northwestern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=e7950863-a35f-460c-8b58-ad1901358508" target="_blank">demo of (some of the) optional functionality</a>.

<!-- 
## Part 4: Make a Landing Page (8 Points)
For the Landing Page UI, you will be making changes to `index.html` and `scripts/landing.js`, and `css/landing.css`. The current screen looks like this: 

<img src="/winter2022/assets/images/hw3/landing.png" style="width:50%;" />

Please change it! Feel free to be as creative as you like, so long as you meet the following criteria:

* [2 pts] Make your UI **responsive**:<br> It should adjust appropriately to the screen dimensions of a desktop, tablet, and mobile.
* [1 pt] Use custom fonts:<br>Select (and apply) a header font from Google Fonts. Select an appropriate body font (either using Google fonts or one of the available browser fonts). Ensure that your fonts are complementary and that they match the values / theme of the website.
* [1 pt] Instantiate the principles of proximity and alignment:<br>Visually group the different sections of the portfolio. Cluster similar things, apply spacing to things that are different. Be very intentional about aligning and organizing your content.
* [1 pt] Instantiate the principle of contrast:
   * Make some of the most important content stand out
   * De-emphasize some of the finer-grained details (so that the content is easier to skim and discern key takeaways). 
   * Recall that there are many ways to produce contrast (color, size, asymmetry, and so forth).
* [3 pts] Implement a JavaScript interaction:<br>Create some sort of character interaction using your REST API endpoints.

### A note on assets and copyright
For live websites, it is important that you have copyright permission on all assets that you use. See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzzkSZ0Jrko&t=161s" target="_blank">brief video on copyright</a> for an overview of copyright laws in the US. However, for the purposes of this class, we'll be claiming "fair use," as we'll be using these assets for educational purposes (as a means of learning about UI/UX principles).

## Part 6: Submit to Canvas
When you're done, you should submit the following to Canvas:

1. A zip file that contains your `public` directory and your updated `routes.js` file.
1. A link to your live Heroku web server (just paste the link in as a comment on Canvas).
1. A list of your collaborators, if applicable (just list them in the comments section of Canvas).
1. Also, tell us if you attempted the extra credit (totally optional).
