## 1. Introduction
In this assignment, you will be exploring an alternate strategy for creating front-end interfaces. Specifically, instead of rendering your HTML code on the server-side (using Jinja and Flask), you will be asking your Browser to build your UI for you using JavaScript. Within this design paradigm, the browser will load a very simple HTML "skeleton," and then execute some "client-side" JavaScript (that you will write) to build the DOM. 

You will also be implementing some event handlers to interact with the REST API that you made -- in order to like, bookmark, and comment on posts; and to follow new users. And finally, you'll continue working to ensure that your interface is accessible.


> <h3 style="margin-bottom:10px">A few notes and guidelines</h3>
> * You will be working on the follow / unfollow functionality during [Lab 6](lab06) this week.
> * You will be working on some of the "post" and "modal" functionality in class during the week of 2/14. Please come to class with your files set up because it will be easier to follow along.
> * HW4 assignment is designed to take approximately 5-10 hours (depending on your level of experience). We encourage you to do a little at a time during class and in lab, so that you have enough time to engage with the concepts and complete the exercises without intense stress at the end.
> * You may NOT use any outside CSS or JavaScript libraries (other than Font Awesome). Everything should be done by writing your own "vanilla" HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 2. Set Up
In order to make this assignment a little simpler, we have some adjustments that we would like you to make, which are included in the HW04 starter files. Specifically:

1. We've made a UI for you to test your API.
1. We've updated the `models/post.py` to include some contextual information about the current user. Specifically, if you pass the current user as an argument to the `to_dict()` function, it will indicate whether the current user has liked / bookmarked the post.
1. We've included a CORS directive, indicating that anyone from anywhere in the world can interact with your API.

### 1. Configure your local git repo
Before making any changes to your `photo-app` folder, let's create a snapshot of your current work (from HW03) by creating a `hw03` branch using git:

1. On your terminal or command line, navigate to your photo-app folder.
1. Using git, create a branch called hw03 as follows: `git checkout -b hw03`
1. Now type `git branch` and you should see that there are at least branches: `main`, `hw02`, and `hw03`. Also note that you are currently on the `hw03` branch (it should be green with an asterik next to it).
1. Push your hw03 branch to GitHub as follows: `git push -u origin hw03`
1. Open GitHub in your web browser and verify that your hw03 branch is there.
1. Finally, on your local computer, switch back to your `main` branch (i.e., make `main` the active branch you're working on) by typing `git checkout main`.
1. Verify that you are on your `main` branch by typing `git branch` (you should see an asterik next to it).

### 2. Integrate the new files
Download hw04.zip and unzip it. 

<a class="nu-button" href="/winter2022/course-files/homework/hw04.zip">hw04.zip<i class="fas fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

You should see a directory structure that looks like this:

```bash
├── app.py
├── models
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── api_structure.py
│   ├── post.py
│   └── utils.py
├── static
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── api-docs.css
│   │   └── starter-client.css
│   └── js
│       ├── api.js
│       └── hw04.js
├── templates
│   ├── api
│   │   ├── api-docs.html
│   │   ├── include-endpoint-detail.html
│   │   └── include-form.html
│   ├── includes
│   │   └── navbar.html
│   └── starter-client.html
└── views
    ├── posts.py
    └── security.py
```

Please integrate the starter files as follows:

1. Copy `__init__.py`, `api_structure.py`, `post.py`, and `utils.py` from `hw04/models` into `photo-app/models`.
1. Copy `posts.py` and `security.py` from `hw04/views` into `photo-app/views`.
1. Replace `photo-app/app.py` file with `hw04/app.py`.
1. Copy the `css` and `js` folders from `hw04/static` into `photo-app/static`.
1. Copy the `api`,  `includes`, and `starter-client.html` from`hw04/templates` into `photo-app/templates`.

### 3. Verify Your Installation
Navigate to `photo-app` on your command line, and run flask (`flask run`). You should see the following screens when navigating to the following two pages (respectively):
* <a href="http://localhost:5000" target="_blank">http://localhost:5000</a>
* <a href="http://localhost:5000/api" target="_blank">http://localhost:5000/api</a>

#### Homepage:
This is the page you will be modifying for this homework:
<img class="large frame" alt="screen shot of the stories panel" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw04/starter.png"/>

#### API Tester: 
This page may help you formulate your fetch requests using JavaScript:
<img class="large frame" alt="screen shot of the stories panel" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw04/api.png"/>

In addition, your API Endpoints (from HW3) should all still work.

### 4. Tips
While we've provided some starter HTML and CSS...

{:.compact}
* `templates/starter-client.html`
* `static/css/starter-client.css`
* `static/js/hw04.js`

...you are encouraged to use the HTML and CSS that you made in HW1 & HW2. If the starter code doesn't help, feel free to do it your way.

## 3. Your Tasks
Please complete the following tasks by making modifications to:

{:.compact}
* `templates/starter-client.html`
* `static/css/starter-client.css`
* `static/js/hw04.js`

You're welcome to add more CSS & JS files as needed (though this is not necessary).

{:#init}
### 1. Page Initialization Tasks (8 Points)
The functionality in this section must be invoked when the page first loads (so that the user sees each of these panels right away).

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Figure</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>0pts</td>
            <td>Stories Panel</td>
            <td>
                <strong>ALREADY DONE FOR YOU.</strong> Render an HTML representation of stories from the user's network using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/stories</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1pt</td>
            <td>Right Panel: User Profile
            </td>
            <td>
                Inside of the right panel at the top, render an HTML representation of the current user's profile using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/profile</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>Right Panel: Suggested Accounts</td>
            <td>
                Inside of the right panel (underneath the user profile), render an HTML representation of suggested user accounts using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/suggestions</code> endpoint.
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5pts</td>
            <td>Posts Panel</td>
            <td>
                Underneath the stories panel, renter an HTML representation of the first 10 posts from the user's network using data from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/api/posts</code> endpoint. Please ensure that the following rules are honored:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        (Same as HW2) If there is more than one comment associated with the post, display a “view all n comments” button and the first post below it (replace n by the actual number of comments). Otherwise, display a single comment below the title of the post (if one exists).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the current user has already liked the post, the heart icon should be red <i style="color: #cf0c0c" class="fas fa-heart"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-heart"></i>. Consider using the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">current_user_like_id</code> attribute included in the post object.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the current user has already bookmarked the post, the bookmark icon should be black <i class="fas fa-bookmark"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-bookmark"></i>. Consider using the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">current_user_bookmark_id</code> attribute included in the post object.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
            <td><a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Note that the content from each box should be generated from the API data (no hard-coding).

### 4. Accessibility Features (6 points)
Accessibility can be tricky when you're relying on the fetch API, because a screen reader doesn't always know that content has changed on the page. In addition, you don't want to be over-reliant on the mouse. Please take a look at the [Accessibility Resources](/winter2022/accessibility-reference/), and specifically the resources pertaining to aria roles and attributes.

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Points</th>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Keyboard Navigation
            </td>
            <td>
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Ensure that all of the buttons are tabbable</li>
                    <li>Ensure that all the event handlers can be triggered using the "spacebar" or "enter / return" keys.</li>
                    <li>Hint: if you use the HTML <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;button&gt;&lt;/button&gt;</code> element for all of your buttons, you get this functionality for free.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Aria attributes
            </td>
            <td>
                Use the 'aria-label' and 'aria-checked' attributes to indicate to the screen reader whether the following buttons are turned on or off:
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Like / Unlike button</li>
                    <li>Bookmark / Unbookmark button</li>
                    <li>Follow / Unfollow button</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2pts</td>
            <td>
                Modal Box (Post Detail)
            </td>
            <td>
                Attend to the focus of the modal so that the screen reader doesn't get disoriented. Specifically:
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>When the modal opens, the close control should have the focus.</li>
                    <li>When the modal closes, the "View all X comments" button that triggered the modal to open should have the focus.</li>
                    <li>Extra credit (2 points): make the "Escape" key close the modal (in addition to the close button), and make sure the focus still returns to the "View all X comments" button.</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

### 5. Accessibility Reflection (3 Points)
1. What resources did you consult as you implemented the accessibility features? Were there any that you found useful that aren't on the Accessibility Resources page?
1. Reflect on the work that went into making your website accessible. 
  * Was it a lot of additional work? 
  * What was the most challenging part?
  * Do you think that designing for accessibility also improves the usability of the site for all users? Why or why not?

{:#heroku}
### 6. Deploy to Heroku (1 Point)
Please check in all of your changes / additional files to Git, and deploy your completed app to Heroku.
* If you already have your Heroku app set to auto-deploy, then your changes will automatically deploy once you push your changes to GitHub, and you therefore don't need to do anything.
* If your app is not set to auto-deploy, make sure to navigate to the "Deploy" tab and click the "Deploy" button.
