## 1. Introduction

## 2. Set Up (Optional)
For this assignment, you're welcome to write all of your code from scratch and not use any of the templates. That said, if it is helpful to you

1. Configure the API Tester
    * `app.py`
    * `static/api`
    * new model

2. Update the Post model and the `views/posts.py` endpoint
    * Describe changes

3. Note the structure of the `index.html` file (which will be populated using JavaScript).

## 3. Your Tasks
Please complete the following tasks. Feel free to use the <a href="https://photo-app-demo.herokuapp.com/api" target="_blank">API tester</a> that we made to help you. 

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> **OPTIONAL**

> If you want to configure the API tester to work on your version of your flask app, please follow <a href="https://photo-app-demo.herokuapp.com/api" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.

{:#init}
### 1. Page Initialization Tasks (10 Points)
The functionality in this section must be invoked when the page first loads (so that the user sees each of these panels right away). Note that the navigation panel will still be rendered by a server-side include.

<table class="rubric">
    <thead>
        <tr>

                    <li>
                        If there is more than one comment associated with the post, display a “view all n comments” button and the first post below it (replace n by the actual number of comments). Otherwise, display a single comment below the title of the post (if one exists).
                    </li>
                    <li>If the current user has already liked the post, the heart icon should be red <i style="color: #cf0c0c" class="fas fa-heart"></i>. Otherwise it should be hollow <i class="far fa-heart"></i>.</li>

            <td><a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a></td>

Note that the content from each box should be generated from the API data (no hard-coding).

### 3. Post Detail Modal (5 Points)

                Aria attributes
            </td>
            <td>
                Use the 'aria-label' and 'aria-checked' attributes to indicate to the screen reader whether the following buttons are turned on or off:
                <ul class="compact">
                    <li>Like / Unlike button</li>

            <td>

                    <li>When the modal closes, the "View all X comments" button that triggered the modal to open should have the focus.</li>
                    <li>Extra credit (2 points): make the "Escape" key close the modal (in addition to the close button), and make sure the focus still returns to the "View all X comments" button.</li>
                </ul>
            </td>

{:#writeup}
### 5. Accessibility Reflection (3 Points)
* What resources did you consult as you implemented the accessibility features? 
* We there any that you found useful that aren't on the Accessibility Resources page?
* Reflect on the work that went into making your website accessible. Was it a lot of additional work? Do you think the features you implemented improve the usability of the site for everyone?

{:#heroku}
### 6. Deploy to Heroku (1 Point)
Please check in all of your changes / additional files to Git, and deploy your completed app to Heroku.
* If you already have your Heroku app set to auto-deploy, then your changes will automatically deploy once you push your changes to GitHub, and you therefore don't need to do anything.
* If your app is not set to auto-deploy, make sure to navigate to the "Deploy" tab and click the "Deploy" button.

## 4. What to Turn In
Please review the requirements above and ensure you have met them. Specifically:

{:.small}
| [10 points](#init)  | Page initialization |
| [15 points](#events)  | POST / DELETE functionality |
| [5 points](#post-detail) | post detail modal |
| [6 points](accessibility) | Accessibility features |
| [3 points](#writeup) | Accessibility reflection |
| [1 point](#heroku)  | Heroku deployment |


### Canvas Submission
When you're done, please submit the following to canvas:

{:.checkbox-list}
* A zip file of your code
* A comment that includes the following:
    * A link to your Heroku app
    * Your responses to the accessibility questions
    * The name of your partner (if applicable)
    * A description of the extra credit you did (if applicable).
