## Accessibility Goals
Next steps re: accessibility:
* Making sure your website makes sense w/o CSS
* Load times.
* Turn off images and see if the site is coherent.
* Download the WAVE Extension -- Use one of the automated testing resources and take a screenshot, submit it, and address issues or talk about how you would.
