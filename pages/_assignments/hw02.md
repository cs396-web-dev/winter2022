A few quick notes and guidelines:
* The collaboration and code sharing policy is the same as [HW1](hw01).
* Feel free to use the Lab 2 solutions and lecture files as a guide.

## 1. Introduction
In this assignment, you will be doing two things: 
1. Converting the static HTML file that you made in HW1 into a data-driven, server-side template.
1. Doing a few more design checks to ensure your site is accessible.

As we saw in [Lab 2](lab02), the Jinja templates (used by flask) allow python logic to be evaluated from within the HTML template, using a set of template variables and expressions (see <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/" target="_blank">Jinja documentation</a>). This allows you to create custom, server-generated HTML files that merge with relevant data. For this lab, we will be working with fake data, generated using the `faker` python module. In HW3, we will be connecting to a database.
* **Pro Tip:** For those of you who plan to take more prototyping courses after this one, `faker` is a great way to create fake data for testing and prototyping.

## 2. Background Readings & Resources
* [Readings from Lecture 4](../lectures/lecture04)
* <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/" target="_blank">Flask documentation</a>
* <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/" target="_blank">Jinja documentation (for templates)</a>

## 3. Setup

<a class="nu-button" href="/winter2022/course-files/homework/hw02.zip">hw02.zip<i class="fas fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>

### 1. Organize files
1. Download the `hw02.zip` file, unzip it, and copy the contents of the hw02 folder into your existing `photo-app` folder (from HW1).
1. Move the `index.html` file that you created in HW1 into the `templates` directory.
1. Move the `style.css` file that you created in HW1 into the `static` directory.
1. Inside of the `head` section of your `index.html` file, update the address of your `style.css` as follows: `href="/static/style.css"`. 

When you're done, your file system should look like this:

```bash
photo-app
├── .git                        # your local git repo (that you created for HW1)
├── Procfile
├── README.md
├── app.py
├── fake_data.py
├── requirements.txt
├── static
│   ├── starter_style.css
│   └── style.css               # your CSS file from HW1
└── templates
    ├── index.html              # your HTML file from HW1
    └── starter_template.html
```

### 2. Configure and run your flask server
Please install the dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# If the above command doesn't work, try one of the commands below (however you did it for lab2):
# py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, set your environment variables and run your local server:

#### Mac or Linux
```bash
# set environment variables (you just have to do this once per session)
export FLASK_APP=app.py     
export FLASK_ENV=development

# then run flask (type Ctrl+C to quit)
flask run
```

#### Windows
```bash
# set environment variables (you just have to do this once per session)
set FLASK_APP=app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development

# then run flask (type Ctrl+C to quit)
flask run
# alternative commands to try if "flask run" doesn't work:
# py -m flask run
# python3 -m flask run
# python -m flask run
```

You should see the following output:
```bash
 * Serving Flask app "app.py" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 273-580-071
 ```


### 3. Get oriented with the files
With your flask server running, navigate to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:5000/</a> in your web browser and take a look at the web page. Currently, there is very little HTML formatting on the page (pictured below), but it displays each of the 4 context variables: `user`, `suggestions`, `stories`, and `posts`. Each time you refresh your page, this data will change (as it is generated on-the-fly using `faker`).

<img class="screenshot" alt="screen shot of starter template" style="width:80%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw02/a.png"/>

Open your `templates/starter_template.html` and `app.py` files in your code editor and take a look at them. See if you can figure out how the data are generated, and how the template is able to access this data.

Then, modify the `home()` function in your `app.py` file so that it merges with the `templates/index.html` file instead of `templates/starter_template.html`. Now, when you access <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:5000/</a> (the root of your website), you should see the same file you submitted in HW1.

## 3. Your Tasks
Please complete the following tasks. You are welcome to use `starter_template.html` and the lab 2 solutions as a guide.

{:#navbar}
### 1. Navigation Bar (2 points)

{:.checkbox-list}
* Convert your navbar to an include file. To do this:
    * Create a new folder inside the `templates` folder called `includes`
    * Inside `includes`, create a file called `navbar.html` 
    * Paste the HTML responsible for the navbar into `navbar.html`
    * In `index.html` file, replace the navbar HTML code with an <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/#include" target="_blank">include tag</a> that references `includes/navbar.html`. See Lab2 for an example.
* Modify your `navbar.html` file so that "gibsonjack" (highlighted in pink below) is replaced by the user's username (using the `user` data from the template's context).

<img class="screenshot" alt="screen shot of the navigation bar" style="width:80%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw02/navbar.png"/>

{:#suggestions}
### 2. Suggestions Panel (4 points)

{:.checkbox-list}
* Convert the suggestions panel into an include file called `suggestions.html` (just like you did with the navigation bar)
* Within `suggestions.html`, ensure that all of the hardcoded content (outlined in pink) is replaced by data stored in the `suggestions` and `user` context variables. This includes:
    * The current user's username and profile pic, which should come from `user`
    * Each of the suggested user accounts, which should come from `suggestions`. 

<img class="screenshot" alt="screen shot of the suggestions panel" style="width:30%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw02/b.png"/>

See the <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/" target="_blank">Jinja documentation</a> for some examples of how to loop through data. There's also a sample in the lab02 solutions.

{:#stories}
### 3. Stories Panel (2 points)

{:.checkbox-list}
* Convert the stories panel into an include file called `stories.html`
* Within `stories.html`, ensure that all of the hardcoded images and usernames (outlined in pink) are replaced by data stored in the `stories` context variable. You will need to use a loop.

<img class="screenshot" alt="screen shot of the stories panel" style="width:75%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw02/stories.png"/>

{:#cards}
### 4. Cards Panel (6 points)

{:.checkbox-list}
* Convert the cards panel into an include file called `cards.html`
* Within `cards.html`, ensure that all of the hardcoded posts, comments, images, etc. are replaced by the data stored in the `posts` context variable (outlined in pink). 
* When outputting the comments: 
    * If there is more than one comment associated with the post:
        * Display a "view all comments" button
        * Display only the first comment below the button
    * Otherwise, just display the single comment below the title of the post (no view all button)


<img class="screenshot" alt="screen shot of a card" style="width:75%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw02/d.png"/>

{:#accessibility}
### 5. Accessibility Analysis (5 points)
Download the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WAVE Extension</a> using either Firefox or Chrome, and use it to generate an accessibility report.  Correct as many accessibility errors as you can. Then take a screenshot of your final accessibility report (Sarah's report is shown below), and answer the following questions in a text file (Word, Notepad, or PDF are all fine):

{:.checkbox-list}
* What corrections did you have to make?
* Given that the photos and captions rely on user-generated content, do you think that the accessibility problems are all solvable? Why or why not?
* Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?
* Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the images? Why or why not?
* Submit a screenshot of your Wave report

<img class="screenshot" alt="screen shot of a card" style="width:100%;" src="/winter2022/assets/images/homework/hw02/wave.png"/>


{:#github}
### 6. GitHub (1 point)
When you're done, please commit all of your changes and push them to your `photo-app` GitHub repo.
