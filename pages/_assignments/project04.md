## What to turn in
For your final deliverable, please write a reflection / self assessment (1-2 pages) that includes the following:
1. A link to your code repository
1. A link to your live website
  * Strongly encouraged unless there is some compelling reason that you were not able to deploy your app.
1. A summary of your project and your process of making the app (feel free to draw from earlier text that you wrote). Please be sure to describe:
  * The overall goal of your project and intended audience.
  * The web technologies / frameworks you used.
  * 1-2 things you learned in the process of completing your project.
  * How you believe you should be evaluated (list your accomplishments and how they relate to the themes of the class). Bullets fine.
  * How you think you did on this project given the evaluation criteria you selected.
  * What your next steps would be if you had more time.


## Rubric

In evaluating your final project, the course staff and I will take the following into account (note that different criteria apply differently, depending on the direction of your project):

* The time/effort you put into your project, and your intellectual curiosity
* Your reflection of your own learning and possible next steps
* Your instantiation of the design / coding / web architecture principles
* Code proficiency / organization.
