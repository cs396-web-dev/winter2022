As youâ€™re learning about web design and implementing components, it will be useful for you to take a look at how existing companies / organizations make design choices. Many companies even make their stylesheets and widget libraries available.

## Style Guides and Guidelines
As you instantiate your frameworks, keep in mind that most companies have standardized widgets, stylesheets, and guidelines to ensure an integrated look-an-feel. Here are some style guides. Please use them to get ideas!

## Podcasts
* For design thinking and general inspiration, [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/) can't be passed up. Many designers love it, saying that it's one of the highlights of their week.
* If you like short podcasts, [Immutable](https://spec.fm/podcasts/immutable) is good. It's very tangible - they talk about specific things, not huge ideas. There's also [Developer Tea](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea) which is also pretty short, and has solid content for all types of people interested in development.
* If you're willing to deal with some longer stuff, consider checking out [Design Details](https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details) (which is a lot of designers talking about how they got into the industry). For visionary, future-oriented design, check out [The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead). There's also [Javascript Air](https://javascriptair.com/) - it's always really good, but it's on the more technical side, and the topics can go on for a long, long time.
* For a podcast manager, [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) is supposed to be a great experience for anyone on iOS.
