## Logging Into Zoom

For security purposes, all zoom meetings will require that you sign-in via your NU account. To do this, you will first navigate to <a href="https://northwestern.zoom.us" target="_blank">https://northwestern.zoom.us</a>, and then join the corresponding meeting. If you don't login to zoom or if you are logged in as a user other than through the NU Single Sign-On, you won't be able to join the zoom.

## Finding Your Zoom Link
* We will have different zoom links for different kinds of activities. All zoom links corresponding to lectures, office hours, and labs will be made available via the [course calendar](../../times-locations/). All zoom meetings will be password-protected (see Canvas for passwords).
* The zoom link for all lectures (Mo, We, Fr 10:00-10:50AM) is: <a href="https://northwestern.zoom.us/j/91751977564" target="_blank">https://northwestern.zoom.us/j/91751977564</a> (Meeting ID: 917 5197 7564).

## Recording (Audio / Video)
We **will** be recording all sessions during regularly scheduled class time. We WILL NOT be recording office hours or lab sessions in order to protect students' privacy.

## Etiquette
To ensure a smooth lecture experience for everyone, we’ll need to follow some simple guidelines.

1. To protect your privacy and avoid outside disruptions, all class-related Zoom meetings will require authentication and be password-protected. You will need to connect to Zoom using Northwestern Single Sign-On (other Zoom accounts you may have will not work). Passwords will be available on the Canvas "Syllabus" page.
2. Keep your audio muted at all times, unless you’re asking a question. Your audio and video should be muted by default when you join the lecture meetings.
3. To ask a question (I love questions!). In the "Participants" pane (opened using the "Participants" button at the bottom of the screen), there is a "raise hand" button. When you raise your hand, I will receive a pop-up, and will acknowledge your question as soon as appropriate. Alternatively, you can just type a question into the chat.
4. We will have a member of the course staff present during lectures to monitor the meeting and the chat. If you think I may not have noticed your question (give me a few moments), or if asking your question directly is an issue (e.g., you prefer not be to recorded, or do not have a microphone), send the staff member on duty a direct message using Zoom’s chat feature.
6. To avoid audio feedback when you speak up, please use headphones during Zoom meetings.
7. We may need to adapt the above and/or introduce new guidelines as the quarter goes on. But above all, we’re relying on everyone doing their part to ensure a conducive learning environment. 

Thank you for your cooperation!
