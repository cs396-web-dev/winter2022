      title: Authentication Continued
---

Today, we will be talking a bit more about authentication and security, including how to store user passwords and protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. We will also be setting up your HW5 files and getting started on the lab. 

If time, we will also work on some JavaScript debugging techniques.
