## Do the Activity

### A. Get your files set up
Open this the CodePen: <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/WWRqRY?editors=0100" target="_blank">https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/WWRqRY</a> and either fork it (and edit it directly on CodePen), or download it to your computer and edit it via Atom.

### B. Experiment with the following CSS techniques
1. **Body copy**: apply some styling to the body text of your HTML page. Experiment with some following text properties: `font-family, font-size, line-height, color, font-size, text-transform, letter-spacing`
1. **Header font**: apply some styling to the h1 tag by selecting, importing and applying a Google Font.
1. **Style the img tag** and see if you can make it look like itâ€™s sitting in a picture frame, using the following box-model properties:<br> `padding, border, border-radius, box-shadow, width`
1. Figure out a way to apply a slightly different heading style to only headers that are inside of sections (which correspond to blog post titles).
1. Create a class that, when applied, turns the text to hot pink.
1. Experiment with the :hover keyword/pseudo-class. Add some hover effects to headings, paragraphs, maybe a row in a table.

> **CHALLENGE**: Create a way that shows a paragraph number next to each paragraph, telling you which number paragraph it is on the page. Also, hide some codewords in one of the paragraphs which only stand out when you hover on the paragraph.
