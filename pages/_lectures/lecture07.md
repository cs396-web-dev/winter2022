Today, we will do a few things: 
1. First, we will go over a few questions that came up around the concept of the `INNER JOIN`. 
1. Next, we will discuss REST APIs (representational state transfer) -- an architectural style for creating, update, reading, and deleting data over HTTP. 
1. Finally, we will take a look at some existing REST APIs (e.g. Spotify, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) in order to study how they organize their REST interfaces.
