> <a href="https://github.com/cooperbarth" target="_blank">Cooper Barth</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Ajuogaaz" target="_blank">Linus Okoth</a>, Victoria Chávez, and Sarah Van Wart each designed / developed different parts of this this course, including building the homeworks, labs, and figuring out the scope of the course.

## Learning Goals
1. Learning how to design and develop a simple ‘full-stack’ web application (including interacting with a database, building a web server, implementing user authentication, and designing/building a front-end client).
2. Building proficiency with commonly-used tools and technologies related to web development (e.g. GitHub, Flask, Heroku, Amazon S3, Web Sockets, testing frameworks like Mocha & Selenium, React, etc).
3. Studying different architectures (e.g. REST & MVC), including how they are instantiated across a range of familiar web applications and APIs.
4. Learning some fundamental UX/UI design principles (usability, accessibility, visual design, prototyping) in the context of web development.

## Course Format

### 1. Lectures & Labs
Lectures, which are dedicated to introducing new topics, will take place every Monday and Wednesday.

### 2. Homework Assignments
You will work on 8 individual homework assignments throughout the quarter. These assignments will all involve coding in a variety of different languages (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, etc.) across the web stack.

### 3. Weekly Labs
On Thursdays and Fridays, you will be completing labs. Some of the labs will help you install, configure, and build a ‘full stack web application.’ Other labs will involve designing, building, and testing versions of your final project. 

You will sign up for a lab slot during the first week of classes.

### 4. Project
The quarter will culminate in an open-ended project that demonstrates your knowledge of course concepts. You will develop a ‘full stack’ web application in the domain of your choosing, This will involve identifying an appropriate system architecture, setting up required databases and servers, designing and building your own interface, and deploying to the cloud.

### Office Hours
Consider office hours as an extension of the class, and we want you to rely on them to get the help you need for assignments. We expect that everyone will need to attend office hours from time to time throughout the quarter. Many students opt to go every week. Office hours will be posted on the course's [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=aDg5bnY4ZjlpZ3ZtcmNyb25wdGV0ZG51dGNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).


## Grading
Your final grade will be assessed as follows:

### 80% – Homework
You will have 8 homework assignments that will each be worth roughly 10% of your grade (though some homework assigments are worth more than others).

### 20% – Labs
Your lab grade will be based on your engagement during labs, which includes the quality of your lab submissions and your lab attendance. You may miss two labs without a grade penalty.

### Other Grading Logistics

#### Late Work Policy
* Late work will be accepted (within 48 hours of the deadline) with a 20% penalty.
* No work will be accepted 48 hours after the deadline (unless you work with the Dean of Students).

#### Final Grade Calculations
Final grades are assigned on a fixed scale: 93-100 is an A, 90-92.99 is an A-, 87-89.99 is a B+, etc. Some other logistics:

* Final course grades will not be rounded or curved.
* We will not be using the final exam time allocated for this class.


## Policy on Academic Honesty
In the past, there have been a few unfortunate instances in which students have presented work other than their own. For the programming assignments: You are allowed (encouraged, even!) to discuss general approaches to solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own. Here are some specific guidelines to make sure you don’t cross the line:

1. Do not exchange programs or program fragments in any form -- on paper, via e-mail, or by other means -- unless it is between members of your group (only if you are working on a group assignment).
1. You are welcome to look up approaches to solving various web-related problems using the Internet (Stack Overflow, online blogs, etc). That said, if you make use of code you find on a website / resource, you must (a) understand how it works (and be able to explain it if you are asked to), and (b) cite your sources. You MAY NOT look at solutions from other students or from students who have taken this course in a previous quarter.
1. While working with other students, it is perfectly acceptable to ‘look’ at each other’s code (perhaps while helping someone to debug), but you should NEVER be scribing (typing or writing) your own work while looking at someone else’s (on a computer screen, paper, whiteboard, etc.).
1. Uploading materials from this course to websites that sell such content to students is prohibited by Northwestern’s academic integrity policies, and may also put you at risk for violating copyright policies in Northwestern’s Student Conduct Code.

Contact Sarah Van Wart if you have any questions about what is appropriate.
