> <a href="https://github.com/cooperbarth" target="_blank">Cooper Barth</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Ajuogaaz" target="_blank">Linus Okoth</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vickiebananas/" target="_blank">Victoria Chávez</a>, and Sarah Van Wart each designed / developed different parts of this this course, including building the homeworks, labs, and figuring out the scope of the course.

## Learning Goals
1. Learning how to design and develop a simple ‘full-stack’ web application (including interacting with a database, building a web server, implementing user authentication, and designing/building a front-end client).
2. Building proficiency with commonly-used tools and technologies related to web development (e.g. GitHub, Flask, Heroku, Amazon S3, Web Sockets, testing frameworks like Mocha & Selenium, React, etc).
3. Studying different architectures (e.g. REST & MVC), including how they are instantiated across a range of familiar web applications and APIs.
4. Learning some fundamental UX/UI design principles (usability, accessibility, visual design, prototyping) in the context of web development.

## Course Format

### 1. Lectures & Labs
Lectures, which are dedicated to introducing new topics, will take place every Monday and Wednesday.

### 2. Homework Assignments
You will work on 8 individual homework assignments throughout the quarter. These assignments will all involve coding in a variety of different languages (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, etc.) across the web stack.

### 3. Weekly Labs
On Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, you will be completing labs -- which are designed to help you install, configure, and explore various ideas around building a ‘full stack web application.’ You will sign up for a lab slot during the first week of classes.

### Office Hours
Consider office hours as an extension of the class, and we want you to rely on them to get the help you need for assignments. We expect that everyone will need to attend office hours from time to time throughout the quarter. Many students opt to go every week. Office hours will be posted on the course's [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=aDg5bnY4ZjlpZ3ZtcmNyb25wdGV0ZG51dGNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).


## Grading
Your final grade will be assessed as follows:

### 80% – Homework
You will have 8 homework assignments that will each be worth roughly 10% of your grade (though some homework assigments are worth more than others).

### 20% – Labs
Your lab grade will be based on the quality of your lab submissions. Your two lowest lab scores will be dropped, though we strongly encourage you to complete all of the labs.

### Final Grade Calculations
Final grades are assigned on a fixed scale: 93-100 is an A, 90-92.99 is an A-, 87-89.99 is a B+, etc. Some other logistics:

* Final course grades will not be rounded or curved.
* We will not be using the final exam time allocated for this class.

### What if I think the grader made a mistake?
If you believe that your grader made a mistake, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/yXLvMnPG2w9bbgGM9" target="_blank">this regrade request form</a>. Keep in mind that your entire assignment will be regraded, meaning that your grade could go down as a result of submitting the form.

## Late Policy
* No late labs will be accepted (because we post solutions right away). 
* Regarding homework: we have created a "late credits" policy (see below)

### Late Credits
Because this has already been a chaotic quarter with Omicron, etc., we have decided to instill a system of "Late Credits." Over the course of the quarter, you have **7 "late credits"** that you can allocate across HW1-HW7, no questions asked. The purpose of these late credits is to give you some flexibility if you get sick or have a personal emergency, as Sarah and the course staff are having difficulty keeping track of all of the extension requests. 

* Note that HW8 MUST be submitted on time (3/16) because of the Ceasar grading deadline.

#### How do credits work?
* 1 credit = 1 day
* Credits cannot be split / partially allocated. For instance:
    * If you submit a HW assignment 18 hours late, you will spend 1 credit towards that HW (with 6 left over to use for future homeworks). 
    * If you submit a homework 27 hours late, you will spend 2 credits towards that HW (with 5 left over to use for future homeworks). 
* HW submissions have a 2-hour, no-penalty grace period: if you turn in your assignment 1 hour and 59 minutes late, you don't need to use any of your credits.
* Credits can only be applied to homework, not labs.
* If you use up your 7 credits, the original late submission policy for homework kicks in:
    * Late work will be accepted (within 48 hours of the deadline) with a 20% penalty.
    * No work will be accepted 48 hours after the deadline (unless you work with the Dean of Students).

To apply your "late credits" to an assignment, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/W5BeMPimUDMUgDqw9" target="_blank">this form</a>
* You must fill out the form in order for your grader to apply your late credits.

#### A Caveat
In this course, each assignment builds on the previous one, so turning things in late can make the next assignment more stressful. We strongly encourage you to only use the late credits when you absolutely need to use them, so that you can avoid falling behind.

#### What if I need more support?
If you need more leniency beyond the 7 credit system because of extraordinary circumstances, please reach out to the Dean of Students and work with them to come up with a plan. Sarah cannot grant further accommodations without involvement from the student affairs people, to be fair to other students.

## Policy on Academic Honesty
In the past, there have been a few unfortunate instances in which students have presented work other than their own. For the programming assignments: You are allowed (encouraged, even!) to discuss general approaches to solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own. Here are some specific guidelines to make sure you don’t cross the line:

1. Do not exchange programs or program fragments in any form -- on paper, via e-mail, or by other means -- unless it is between members of your group (only if you are working on a group assignment).
1. You are welcome to look up approaches to solving various web-related problems using the Internet (Stack Overflow, online blogs, etc). That said, if you make use of code you find on a website / resource, you must (a) understand how it works (and be able to explain it if you are asked to), and (b) cite your sources. You MAY NOT look at solutions from other students or from students who have taken this course in a previous quarter.
1. While working with other students, it is perfectly acceptable to ‘look’ at each other’s code (perhaps while helping someone to debug), but you should NEVER be scribing (typing or writing) your own work while looking at someone else’s (on a computer screen, paper, whiteboard, etc.).
1. Uploading materials from this course to websites that sell such content to students is prohibited by Northwestern’s academic integrity policies, and may also put you at risk for violating copyright policies in Northwestern’s Student Conduct Code.

Contact Sarah Van Wart if you have any questions about what is appropriate.
