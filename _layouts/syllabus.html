                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and will present new, unexpected challenges to our class and to our community at Northwestern. I want to acknowledge that things are difficult for many of us on multiple fronts. Some thoughts:</p>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Your health and well-being is always top priority. Please communicate with me if you have something going on so that we can figure out a path forward together.</li>
                        <li>There are numerous resources at Northwestern that are in place to support stuednts with extenuating circumstances (e.g. CAPS, talking to your academic advisor, talking to the dean of students, etc.). I can help you navigate these paths if you need help.</li>
